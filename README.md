# Concurrency Patterns in Rust

An exercise to implement concurrency patterns in Rust in different ways and with different tools.

Initially inspired by [Visualizing Concurrency in Go](https://divan.github.io/posts/go_concurrency_visualize/) by [@divan](https://github.com/divan) but open to include other pattern implementations from the Web.

Check the `examples/` folder and run each example with `cargo run --example <filename without extension>`.
